<title>Emily Ratajkowski's Body</title>
<description>For model Emily Ratajkowski, there's a blurred line between empowerment and objectification. Coming up in the world of modeling, a harrowing experience with a photographer provided an early education in power dynamics, shame and what it means to be the object of desire. Her essay on that experience for The Cut went viral last year. Now, she's expanded on the ideas in that piece in a new memoir called "My Body." The Cut's executive producer Hanna Rosin talked to Emily about starring in an infamous music video, growing up with a woman's body and taking control of how that body was viewed as an adult.

The Cut’s B.A. Parker talks to journalist Anna Louie Sussman about the logistics and ethics of egg freeze and share programs, and how different women feel about giving away their eggs in order to gain a shot at becoming parents later in life.

<title>20 Years Ago, She Warned Us About R. Kelly </title>
<description>Sparkle knew R. Kelly as a mentor and friend. She introduced her 12-year-old niece, an aspiring rapper, to him 20 years ago. And then a sex tape surfaced—a tape that Sparkle said showed Kelly was abusing her niece. When she raised the alarm, no one listened. Instead, Dave Chappelle made a parody of it, and we all laughed it off. For decades, Sparkle has been paying the price for speaking out. She spoke to us about her role in bringing Kelly to justice and her reaction to the verdict. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices</description>

<title>We're All Failing At Being Women</title>
<description>There is so much to say about Detransition, Baby by Torrey Peters. Lauded as the first book by a trans author to be released by a major publishing house, Detransition, Baby is a novel about queerness, motherhood, mothering, and, ultimately, the way we all present our genders. This week, Torrey speaks about how the Kardashians have “transitioned” from female to female, the impossible performance of womanhood, and how the common feeling of “failing at gender” can bridge divides between cis and trans women.

<title>The Truth About False Memories</title>
<description>The Lost in the Mall experiment is a classic case study in Psych 101 classes. The study's conclusion: if you are told something happened to you as a child, you're inclined to believe it and that we're all susceptible to false memories being implanted in our minds. But the story behind this study is complicated. And so is the nature of memory. Cut writer Katie Heaney and host Avery Trufelman investigate how an accusation of sexual assault turned shakey science into widely accepted truth. Learn more about your ad choices.

<title>Would You Move Back Home? Could You?</title>
<description>For more than a decade now, NYM Editor-at-Large Stella Bugbee has lived with her parents, and raised a family in the home she grew up in. But for a long time, she kept that a secret, perhaps because it's so stigmatized in American culture. But the percentage of people living multigenerational households has been on the rise since the 1980s. In this episode, we'll hear from people who've done it out of necessity, and by choice—even when it's not the easy choice. Learn more about your ad choices.

<title>The Joy of Sext</title>
<description>Now that hookup culture is on pause, sexting has become a true form of intimacy. And it’s really highlighted how terrible dick pics can be. Aesthetically. We're talking terrifying angles. Ghastly use of flash. Toilets in the background. This week on The Cut: the art of the nude, and why people socialized as male aren’t allowed to see themselves as desirable. The Cut is made possible by the team at New York Magazine.

<title>Nature is Healing</title>
<description>The images of dolphins in the Venice canals and coyotes parading through Chicago and elephants asleep in a field were held up as the silver lining of 2020. And from these nature memes emerged a sort of mantra: “nature is healing, we are the virus.” But is humanity the virus we’ve condemned ourselves to be?

<title>Optimism </title>
<description>Being an optimist seems ridiculous right now. Especially because the meaning of the word itself is slipping, amid polite talks of "optimistic" reopening schedules and "optimistic" vaccine timelines. The word has become a euphemism for... delusional. In this inaugural episode of the new podcast of The Cut, host Avery Trufelman tries to navigate what it means to begin a new chapter in 2020. Maybe it doesn't matter if the glass is half empty or half full. Maybe we should just throw the liquid out all together. Or maybe we've all just been defining optimism wrong, and the people who have come to represent optimism incarnate have a lot to teach us. Learn more about your ad choices.

<title>You're Hired</title>
<description>When you start a new job, maybe you’ve got a fantasy of the life you want to lead—the new and improved person you want to be. But then you walk in the door, and your fantasy future collides with reality. So: What comes next? In this episode, we talk to Congresswoman Lauren Underwood and Uncanny Valley author Anna Wiener about intense new jobs, and how to embrace the optimism of a fresh start without losing yourself in the process.

<title>Penis Envy and Other Problems</title>
<description>Ben Lerner is not known for freestyling. He's known for writing novels (also poems). But as a kid growing up in Topeka, Ben was deep in a world of male anger—anger that found outlets in debate championships, drunken fistfights, and, yes, also white-guy rap battles. And while Ben was growing up, his mom, Harriet Lerner, was navigating a world of anger, too. In this episode, Ben and Harriet talk about how their family's life shaped Ben's new novel, The Topeka School. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices</description>

<title>We Went to Elizabeth Warren's House</title>
<description>Elizabeth Warren has spent most of her career as a teacher. Before she faced off with a stage full of opponents for the Democratic nomination, she was facing off with a room full of rowdy 5th graders intent on cutting each other's hair. So what would it mean to have a teacher-in-chief? On this week's episode, Rebecca Traister pays Warren a visit to talk about her life in the classroom (and drink tea on her sun porch)—and we call Warren’s students to see what they have to say.

<title>What If You Regret Becoming a Mom? </title>
<description>This week, we listen in on a conversation between Dr. Alexandra Sacks, host of the new podcast Motherhood Sessions, and Anne. Anne never wanted to be a mom.

Anne's now the mother of a toddler, and she's still struggling with lingering doubts about motherhood. You can listen to more episodes of Motherhood Sessions, on Spotify, or wherever you listen.

We're working on an episode about calling our moms -- because, at any given time, there's a decent chance we should probably call our moms. But what's the thing you really need to call you mom about, the call you've been putting off? Is there a confession you've been too afraid to make? A question you've always wanted to ask? Or an apology that's long overdue? Psych yourself up by giving us a call and telling us about it. And, if you want us to help you out with your mom call, leave your name and number and we'll see what we can do. Our number is 413-247-4698. Learn more about your ad choices.

<title>Ferrante Forever: We Revisit My Brilliant Friend</title>
<description>This week we’re talking about the Neapolitan novels, by Elena Ferrante. An adaptation of the first book in that series, My Brilliant Friend, is coming to HBO later this month... and we’re using that as an excuse to revisit Ferrante's world. With Ruth Spencer, Ann Goldstein, Samhita Chakraborty, Aminatou Sow, Danielle Oteri, and Dayna Tortorici.

<title>"He's Coming After Us": A List and a Lawsuit</title>
<description>The Shitty Media Men list, an anonymously sourced Google spreadsheet, was online for less than 24 hours last fall -- but we're still feeling its effects. On this week's show, we talk about what it's like to watch a whisper network in real time, and the recent lawsuit that has the list back in the news. Plus, we take a look at another anonymous list... one that appeared on a bathroom wall at Brown University in 1990. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices</description>
